## Detecting the various emotios in music audio clips using k-NN Classifier Algorithm

Music emotion recognition (MER) detects the inherently emotional expression of people for a music clip. MER is helpful in music understanding, music retrieval, and other music-related applications. As volume of online musical contents expands rapidly in recent years, demands for retrieval by emotion have been emerging lately. Determining the emotional content of music computationally is an interdisciplinary research involving not only signal processing and machine learning, but the understanding of auditory perception, psychology, cognitive science, and musicology.
In this project, a K-NN based classification system based on music feature pre-described by the domain knowledge is proposed.


### Plotting the various features extracted from the audio files is done using MatplotLib and Seaborn

### Features are extracted from the audio files using Librosa Library

### ML algorithm used - k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
